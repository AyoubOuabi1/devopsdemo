- Access to the EC2 instance through SSH.

## Introduction

Completing the following steps will enable you to download and install Jenkins on your AWS EC2 instance. Follow the steps below after connecting to your EC2 instance.

## Step 1: Update Software Packages

Ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance by using the following command to perform a quick software update:

```bash
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum update â€“y
```
## Step 2: Add Jenkins Repository

Add the Jenkins repository using the following command:

```bash
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \ https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
```

## Step 3: Import Jenkins-CI Key

Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:

```bash
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum upgrade
```

## Step 4: Install Java

Install Java :

```bash
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
```
## Step 5: Install Jenkins

```

## Step 6: Enable Jenkins Service

Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot:

```bash

Replace `<your_server_public_DNS>` with the actual public DNS of your EC2 instance.
```

## Step 10 : Retrieve Initial Admin Password
As prompted, enter the password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword. Use the following command to display this password:
